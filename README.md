# Thumper

Version 1.0.2

I've made some updates to Thumper, and I hope you find them to be valuable 

In this version, Thumper is expecting the .eml file to be used via a command line switch. 

Please use the program as the following:
	
	./thumper email_file.eml

PLEASE NOTE - THERE IS NO MORE PROMPT FUNCTIONALITY

Thank you. As always, feel free to reach out. brian@briantcarr.com
